This is just a basic app written in Python that can keep the hp for up to four party members, deal     damage, heal and also keep track of their current conditions.

To use it first install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/

Now open the command prompt or powershell from this folder, or navigate to it from them.

Command Prompt and power shell do this by: "cd C:\Users\yourname\downloads\DnD-HP-Calculator" or       whereever your folder is located.

when there simply type in "python dnd_hp.py"

Now you can add your player's names, modify their hp values to the correct ones, and apply any         conditions if they have any.
