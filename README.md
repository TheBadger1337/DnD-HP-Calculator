# DnD HP Calculator

This is just a basic app written in Python that can keep the hp for up to four party members, deal     damage, heal and also keep track of their current conditions.

To use it first install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/

Now open the command prompt or powershell from this folder, or navigate to it from them.

Command Prompt and power shell do this by: "cd C:\Users\yourname\downloads\DnD-HP-Calculator" or       whereever your folder is located.

when there simply type in "python dnd_hp.py"

Now you can add your player's names, modify their hp values to the correct ones, and apply any         conditions if they have any.


# Version 2.0

I've now added in a save function that works nearly correct. It doesn't save the subclasses.
The save function also lets you know if it finished correctly or if the path it's in wasn't
able to save.

I also added in AC, Classes, and Subclasses. Unfortunately the subclasses value doesn't save
but I'll work on fixing this soon.

I'm also trying to work on a scrollbar for the subclasses menu since I think they're 106.
It's a minor inconvience in the long run if it saves but still.

Also working on a background feature that's been giving me trouble but part of it is
implimented it just doesn't display properly. So make sure to keep that with this
version otherwise it may not function properly.
